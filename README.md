# Fifteen-Puzzle
The fifteen puzzle, also known as the 15-puzzle, is a classic sliding puzzle that consists of a 4x4 grid with 15 numbered tiles and an empty square. The goal of the puzzle is to rearrange the tiles by sliding them into the empty space to achieve a particular ordering, often starting with the numbers in ascending order from left to right and top to bottom. The tiles are initially jumbled, and the player must use the empty square to slide tiles around, one at a time, until they reach the desired configuration.
