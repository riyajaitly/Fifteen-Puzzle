# Fifteen-Puzzle
The Fifteen Puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 4x4 grid with numbered tiles. The tiles can be moved horizontally or vertically into an empty space, aiming to arrange them in numerical order from 1 to 15. The goal is to reach the configuration with the tiles in ascending order, usually starting with the empty space in the bottom-right corner.
